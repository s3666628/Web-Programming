            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Lunardo Cinema was first opened in August 1922, when it was called 'The Portland' and was popular with locals and out-of-towners who would travel from far and wide to experience the magic of the motion picture in one of the finest examples of art deco architecture. At the time of its opening it was one of the only cinemas in Victoria able to show movies in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film' target="_blank">70 mm</a> - a higher resolution film gauge than standard 35mm film. Since that time, we have been a firm favourite with movie-buffs and cinema goers looking to see the magic of movies presented as the film makers intended.

            </p>

            <p>To ensure we are able to maintain our tradition of presenting films in their best possible light we have recently invested millions of dollars upgrading our projection and sound systems to the lastest <a href='http://www.dolby.com/us/en/platforms/dolby-cinema.html' target="_blank">Dolby Cinema</a> standards. With Dolby Vision projection and Dolby Atmos sound you will see and hear a movie like never before, setting a new standard in cinema immersion.
            </p>
            <p>For your viewing comfort we have also refurbished all our seating - we are now proud to offer new levels of upgraded seating in both standard and first-class seating. With our first-class seating we are taking luxury to new heights with our 160-degree motorised reclining leather seats.</p>

            <p>Whether you are local to our town or travelling from further afield you will find visiting the Lunardo is an experience you cannot get at your general multiplex cinema. Please come and experience the true magic of the movies - at The Lunardo Cinema.</p>
