          <div>Who is your tutor / instructor</div>
          <div>My Instructor for this module is Trevor, I've looked on Canvas but cannot find Trevor's second name.</div>

          <div>Who is your labber</div>
          <div>If I knew what a a 'labber' was then I would answer this question but I have no idea.</div>

          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I have previously undertaken a Coursera Module on HTML, CSS and Java Script - this was a few years ago now, so I forgotten most of it but hopefully it will come back to me as we progress through this course</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I see myself as more of a programmer than a designer - but would like to be compentent in both areas</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I have worked in Information Technology for many years - mainly in software testing, but this area is becoming more technically focused so I decided to improve my skills and learn how to write programs</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I would like to gain a solid understanding of how websites are constructed and very interested to learn some server side code.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>My strenghts are my experience in IT and that I have managed to obtain very good grades in the previous modules, so I am motivated to do well in the assignments and try and get an HD. I also like to keeo on top of assignments, although this isn't always possible with work and family obligations.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>One of the webistes I use a lot is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/' target="_blank">YouTube</a> which has lost of interesting videos on there but you can end up wasting a lot of time as the site is very good at keeping you engaged.
          I also check the <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/au' target="_blank">The Guardian</a> website most days to keep up to date with news and current affairs. Although, I sometimes question whether it would be better to know less about the problems of the world.  
          </div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>
          <p>Interesting hobbies, hmmmm, I don't have much time for hobbies due to work and study but I still like to go running at least 3 times a week - not sure you could call this a hobby. I like movies and video games - currently playing <a href='https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/' target="_blank"> Red Dead Redemtion 2</a> which is an interesting game where you play as an outlaw cowboy at the turn of the 20th century.</p> 
         <p>I am also interested in politics, history and philosphy. I am currently reading <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital' target="_blank">Das_Kapital</a> by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx' target="_blank">Karl Marx</a> which covers all of these topics and plenty more. One of my favourite authors is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell' target="_blank"> George Orwell</a> who wrote many great novels including <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four' target="_blank">1984</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_and_Out_in_Paris_and_London' target="_blank">Down and Out in Paris and London</a>, I highly recommend both of these books.
